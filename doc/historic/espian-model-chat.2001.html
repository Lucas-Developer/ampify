<html><head></head><body>[07:08] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; ok, i wanna discuss the espian model with you guys
<br>[07:08] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; and get your thoughts, criticisms, etc on it
<br>[07:09] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; up for it?
<br>[07:09] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; sure
<br>[07:10] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; ok...
<br>[07:10] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; the aim of esp/espians is simple... to take over the world ;p
<br>[07:10] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; I like it :)
<br>[07:11] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; Can I be the ruler of the Midwest :)
<br>[07:11] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; we start off with three layers of espians - full / fuzzy / open
<br>[07:11] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; look ;p
<br>[07:11] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; I will but AaronSw to work in my salt mine
<br>[07:12] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; is "fuzzy" part time?
<br>[07:12] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; basically
<br>[07:12] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; there's an important distinction...
<br>[07:12] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; full - get base salary + share in ecclesia
<br>[07:12] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; fuzzy - share in ecclesia
<br>[07:13] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; what does open geT?
<br>[07:13] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; open - recognised as trustworthy individuals
<br>[07:13] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; basically, open signifies that you are on this side of the espian sphere, as 

opposed to that side ;p
<br>[07:14] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; heh
<br>[07:14] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; that make sense?
<br>[07:14] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; Yeah...open people are your allies, but they don't really get a say
<br>[07:15] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; no, they get a say, that's an important aspect of their role
<br>[07:15] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; their voice is given more weight than the guy on the street
<br>[07:16] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; hmmm...on mailinglists and such, then?
<br>[07:16] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; and also, with time, open espians evolve into fuzzy / full
<br>[07:16] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; yes, mailing lists, xnet, etc
<br>[07:16] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; OK, I think I get it now
<br>[07:17] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; By your choice of "ecclesia", I assume you vote on decisions?
<br>[07:17] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; *nod*, will get to that in several moments
<br>[07:18] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; now, next the question is, how is one's espian status as full | fuzzy | open 

defined?
<br>[07:18] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; indeed
<br>[07:18] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; this is done through a system of trust metrics, similar to the one on 

advogato to an extent
<br>[07:18] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; it starts off with me as the seed node, bwahahahahahaha!
<br>[07:19] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; heh...do you have this in place right now?
<br>[07:19] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; and i certify individuals as full / fuzzy / open
<br>[07:20] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; yes, and no, atm, i run esp as a benevolent dictator, but the technology for 

doing this is almost in place, so intend to be unleashing the working system fairly soon
<br>[07:20] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; cool
<br>[07:20] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; Is your goal to bring every programmer on earth into this framework and 

take over the world?
<br>[07:20] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; heh, yes ;p
<br>[07:20] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; that would rule
<br>[07:21] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; tav: what is the purpose of espia?
<br>[07:21] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; espia is the name given to the land we shalt take over and declare 

independent, and demonstrate a society with basic socio-economic rights
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; but, ehm, that's a few years into the future still...
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; awesome
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; so, basically, you're a paranoid-delusional? ;-p
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; you better have DSL
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; yes!
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; cool!
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; I'm in.
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; hehe
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; DSL is a basic right! FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; ;)
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; I just had to clear that up.
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; DSL?!
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; OC48's for all.
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; lol
<br>[07:22] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; I need my daily fibre.
<br>[07:23] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; do we have to spell the british way?!
<br>[07:23] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; direct democracy lover...
<br>[07:24] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; so, going back to the model...
<br>[07:24] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; &lt;tav&gt; and i certify individuals as full / fuzzy / open
<br>[07:24] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; right, sorry
<br>[07:25] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; these individuals would then certify other individuals, whose certification 

abilities is decided on how they are certified...
<br>[07:26] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; the final status of an espian is evaluated from all certs from people with 

levels equivalent to or above the level they are certified at...
<br>[07:26] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; right
<br>[07:26] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; the great thing about this system is that, it provides a solid enough model 

to preven malicious external attack, and, at the same time, you can put down those 

certified by the core too
<br>[07:27] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; even the seed node, myself, can be put down ;p
<br>[07:27] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; so does that mean you're at the same level as the other full people?
<br>[07:27] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; yes
<br>[07:28] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; now, at the end of that, we have everyone whose been certified as a full / 

fuzzy / open espian
<br>[07:30] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; the next step, all full espians get credited 1000 pecus for every cert by a 

full espian
<br>[07:30] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; and what can you do with pecus?
<br>[07:30] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; lemme get to that ;p
<br>[07:31] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; pecus = plex economic currency units btw ;p
<br>[07:32] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; now, every espian also belongs to taskforces
<br>[07:33] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; e.g. gdsquad (graphic design squad), espIntelligence, recently renamed 

hackists, espTerrorism, etc
<br>[07:33] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; so, if you were a graphic designer, you would join gdsquad
<br>[07:33] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; yes
<br>[07:33] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; if you also happened to be fluent with zope, join zopists, etc
<br>[07:34] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; so, you join taskforces depending on your skillsets
<br>[07:34] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; on the other side, we have projects...
<br>[07:35] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; e.g. espra, xt, starIM, etc
<br>[07:36] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; now, let's say that i felt that espra should have ogg vorbis support in it's 

audio player
<br>[07:36] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; and, i have had 7 certs from full espians
<br>[07:37] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; How many espians are there currently?
<br>[07:37] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; then, i can say... "i'll pay 1200 pecus to whoever codes ogg vorbis support 

into the espra player"
<br>[07:37] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; stevej: 21
<br>[07:37] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; 12 full / 9 fuzzy
<br>[07:39] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; interesting
<br>[07:39] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; what if 3 people do it, and they fight over who should get how many?
<br>[07:40] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; well, if someone's already signed up to it, you don't sign up to it, unless 

you reckon you can do it better
<br>[07:41] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; also the guy making it can declare it the amount open, and renumerate 

according to how pleased he is with the results
<br>[07:41] *** coderman (fibrill@i48-08-40.pdx.du.teleport.com) has joined #infoanarchy
<br>[07:41] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; and I suppose the developer can down rate the guy if he feels he's been 

gyped
<br>[07:41] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; *nod*
<br>[07:41] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; Kind of like ebay
<br>[07:42] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; the community self moderates
<br>[07:42] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; what is this?
<br>[07:43] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; uh oh, now you're going to have to start over ;)
<br>[07:43] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; lol
<br>[07:43] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; is there a url?
<br>[07:43] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; hmz
<br>[07:43] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; are you still in "stealth mode"?
<br>[07:44] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; yes, we are ;p
<br>[07:44] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; coderman: gimme a sec, lemme upload logs
<br>[07:44] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; okie
<br>[07:44] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; so far, we're to the part where tav uses an advogato style trust metric to 

sign up a bunch of developers to actually develop software -- instead of yak like on 

advogato
<br>[07:45] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; cool.
<br>[07:45] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; i like to yak in code.
<br>[07:46] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; http://tav.espians.com/espian_model_chat
<br>[07:47] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; now, from the perspective of the person doing the work, they get to choose 

things that they _like_ to work on
<br>[07:48] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; yup
<br>[07:48] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; things that they enjoy working on
<br>[07:49] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; and, from the perspective of the person who wants something done, he can 

rely on the certification system, also considering a sub-certification model per 

taskforce, to indicate to the reliability / ability of the individual
<br>[07:51] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; now, you are probably wondering, ok espian x has several thousand pecus, wtf 

does he/she do with them?
<br>[07:51] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; question: what do you think, happens to the pecus? ;p
<br>[07:51] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; buy stuff
<br>[07:51] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; from?
<br>[07:52] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; you could have pecu inflation if too many people get certs
<br>[07:52] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; from other espians
<br>[07:52] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; cool
<br>[07:52] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; i like the idea very much
<br>[07:52] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; coderman: danke
<br>[07:53] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; it is very abitious.  how long have you been working on this project?
<br>[07:53] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; just over a year and a half ;p
<br>[07:54] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; sweet
<br>[07:55] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; look: you hit on very close to the ultimate vision with pecus
<br>[07:55] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; are you going to try to stop cash for pecu transfers?
<br>[07:56] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; but, in the interim, it translates into direct profit share
<br>[07:57] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; atm, the ecclesia, the body comprised of all full / fuzzy espians owns 94%, 

and hopefully 100% again of esp
<br>[07:57] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; hmm.. i would pay buko pecus for a decentralized cell communication 

network with strong encryption to fuel the resistance
<br>[07:58] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; kind of like the one in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress
<br>[07:58] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; hell yeah
<br>[07:59] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; *nod*
<br>[07:59] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; tav: who owns the other 6%?
<br>[07:59] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; investors
<br>[07:59] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; you have vc?
<br>[08:00] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; oh, full espians also get a base salary btw, an amount enough to pay for 

their basic needs, course once we have a society which provides the basic socio-economic 

needs, that won't be needed ;p
<br>[08:00] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; stevej: private investors, lot more agreeable than VCs
<br>[08:01] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; private investors / small investment funds
<br>[08:01] &lt;<font color="red">stevej</font>&gt; that's nice.
<br>[08:02] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; so... what do you guys think?
<br>[08:03] &lt;<font color="red">Orasis</font>&gt; Do you have any lespians there?
<br>[08:03] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; Its definately ambitous!
<br>[08:03] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; lol, not yet
<br>[08:03] &lt;<font color="red">Orasis</font>&gt; huh huh huh, he said lespians, huh
<br>[08:03] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; i like it.  have you given much thought to coordinated maliscious 

attacks?
<br>[08:03] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; coderman: a lot of thought ;p
<br>[08:03] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; yeah, that's what I was wondering
<br>[08:04] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; ehm, did i say that out aloud?
<br>[08:04] &lt;<font color="red">Orasis</font>&gt; My brain is fried, nite guys.
<br>[08:04] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; nite Orasis
<br>[08:05] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; it looks like singular attacks of any kind are easily fixed by 

individuals with a high enough rating (fuzzy/full?)
<br>[08:05] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; *nod*
<br>[08:05] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; but what about groups of people?  Could there potentially be a coup?
<br>[08:05] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; oh you meant attacks to the model
<br>[08:06] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; heh
<br>[08:06] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; yes.
<br>[08:06] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; yes, quite a bit of thought was put into it, but there are a few holes in 

there still
<br>[08:07] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; and like i said earlier, what about people who just buy pecus from other 

people?
<br>[08:07] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; one thing was to limit the rate at which certifications is done
<br>[08:07] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; i suppose any implementation will have its share of problems/quicks, 

but the organization and operation of the reputations and operations..   could a dedicated 

group of people cause mayhem?  and if so, how big of a group would this have to be.  I.e.  

would over 50% of the members have to coordinate for it to be effective?
<br>[08:08] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; the model we use right now to the trust metric evaluation, it's also harder 

to decertify that to certify
<br>[08:08] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; so more weight is needed to decertify than to certify
<br>[08:08] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; cool.
<br>[08:09] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; who controls the "bank"? are you going to use digital cash technology?
<br>[08:09] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; look: the amount of pecus is continuously diluted...
<br>[08:10] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; every month, new pecus are issued depending on how much certification you 

have got from full espians
<br>[08:10] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; could a single host (IP addr) appear as multiple people?  And if so, 

could a person use many certifications to boost a group of bogus peers/users created for 

ill intent?
<br>[08:12] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; i.e., Kuro5hin :b
<br>[08:12] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; I hate multiple log ins
<br>[08:12] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; coderman: assuming, that someone close to the seed has been compromised, and 

started to build up a force to take out the other core, effectively attemp a coup, then, 

because of the time restrictions, they would have to compromise a majority of those close 

to the seed to do so
<br>[08:12] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; and if they can compromise a majority, it's probably time for a change of 

seed ;p
<br>[08:13] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; lol, true.
<br>[08:13] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; thats cool.  that is probably as good as you will get in a 

decentralized system.
<br>[08:13] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; coderman: if you are willing to do the work of x individuals, then, the 

system will accommodate for you having x different personalities ;p
<br>[08:13] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; security / robustness is incredibly hard to do :/
<br>[08:13] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; amen to that
<br>[08:13] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; yeah
<br>[08:14] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; remember, you certifing yourself has no effect
<br>[08:14] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; so basically, you're giving free software an economy
<br>[08:14] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; unless someone certifies you...
<br>[08:16] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; arguably, a well co-ordinated group could work their way up, and start 

certifying individuals, but, unless they managed to integrate into the whole structure 

intricately, then all one needs is to expose one of the root certs, and the whole group is 

affected
<br>[08:16] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; which is why you should ensure that you get a broad range of certs as 

possible
<br>[08:17] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; and to do that, you should do lots of late nite hacking ;p
<br>[08:17] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; sounds like a religion ;)
<br>[08:18] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; kind of like python
<br>[08:18] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; the whole trust system works in python / zope ;p
<br>[08:19] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; so, criticisms / praises of the model.... ?
<br>[08:19] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; rut-rho
<br>[08:19] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; I think it would be fun to build up some pecus
<br>[08:19] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; pecus also translate into meatspace money too, don't forget that
<br>[08:20] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; you might get cert-lamers who, like script kiddies on IRC would run around 

forums demanding "cert me! cert me!"
<br>[08:20] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; tav : sounds sweet.  i see no glaring holes or anything.  It is 

something I would enjoy using
<br>[08:20] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; how are you going to work the translation to money?
<br>[08:20] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; look: would you cert someone saying that? unless you knew them?
<br>[08:20] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; of course not
<br>[08:20] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; But could I shut them up?
<br>[08:21] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; its the annoyance factor I'm worried about ...
<br>[08:21] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; coderman: danke. i'm hoping to get the espian structure stable enough, so 

that i can have almighty hackers like you all to join us ;p
<br>[08:22] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; have businesses / individuals place gold in escrow for projects.  If 

the project is completed within specs, and approved (perhaps by a third, non vested party) 

then the developers get the gold instead of pecus.  
<br>[08:22] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; look: translation to money is simple, actually make money on the projects
<br>[08:23] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; i like gold.  
<br>[08:23] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; heh, that'll be the part I'll have the most trouble with
<br>[08:23] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; good in any economy or country :)
<br>[08:23] &lt;<font color="red">look</font>&gt; so is sex!
<br>[08:23] &lt;<font color="red">coderman</font>&gt; that too.
<br>[08:24] &lt;<font color="red">tav</font>&gt; complete this project, and get a week in espHarem!</body></html>
