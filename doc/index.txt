Ampify
======

Ampify is an open source, decentralised, social platform. We are working towards
an initial release for the end of this year which will provide you with a web
application framework to create social apps on top of a secure, decentralised
core.

Quick Start
-----------

If you've already read the `building Ampify <building-ampify.html>`_ guide, run
the following to build the current code:

.. syntax:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/tav/ampify.git
  $ cd ampify
  $ make
  $ . environ/ampenv.sh

.. raw:: html

  <div style="margin-top: 10px"></div>

And, most importantly, come by and introduce yourself on the ``#esp`` channel on
``irc.freenode.net`` -- we're a friendly bunch!

.. raw:: html

  <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px">
      <form action="http://webchat.freenode.net/" method="get">
        <button style="padding: 2px 6px 3px;">Click to join #esp</button>
        <input type="hidden" name="channels" value="esp" />
     </form>
  </div>


Contribute
----------

To contribute any patches, simply fork `the repository
<http://github.com/tav/ampify>`_ using GitHub, create a new branch with your
patch, add yourself to the ``AUTHORS`` file and then run ``git review submit``,
e.g.

.. syntax:: bash

  # Create a new branch for your patch:
  $ git checkout -b name-for-your-patch

  # Make the various changes you want to make and
  # submit it to be to be reviewed by running:
  $ git review submit

  # Make any changes and submit updates until the
  # reviewers give a LGTM (Looks Good To Me) reply
  # on http://gitreview.com

That's it!

We specifically developed `git-review <http://github.com/tav/git-review>`_ so
that it'd be this easy. It combines code review, build and automated testing so
as to make life easy and pleasant for everyone. Have a look at the review server:
