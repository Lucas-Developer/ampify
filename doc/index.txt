Ampify
======


The Ampify Platform aims to make micro-data powered application development and
decentralised collaboration super easy. For comparison, perhaps imagine a
bastardised mix between Unix, IRC, App Engine, Xanadu and Wikis.

The goal for the 1.0 release is to have a fully decentralised "internet
operating system" style platform, but right now we're working on creating a
basic, working proof of concept: version ``Zero``.


Get Started
-----------

You need to have Git, a recent Python 2.x and general dev tools (gcc, make,
etc.) installed.

.. syntax:: bash

  # clone the source repository.
  $ git clone git://github.com/tav/ampify.git

  # setup ampify related environment variables using
  # the ampenv.sh bash script. you might also want
  # to add the line to your ~/.profile
  # or ~/.bashrc files.
  $ source ampify/environ/ampenv.sh

  # use the new git update command which will now be
  # on your $PATH to keep the repository updated from
  # now on — it also inits and updates git submodules.
  $ cd ampify
  $ git update

  # configure your build and verify you have the
  # necessary dependencies.
  $ cd src
  $ ./configure

  # build various aspects of the ampify platform and
  # verify everything works by running the tests.
  $ make test
