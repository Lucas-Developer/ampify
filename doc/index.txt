Ampify
======

Ampify is a vision of an open and decentralised application platform. For
comparison, perhaps imagine a bastardised mix between Unix, Facebook, IRC, App
Engine, Xanadu and Wikis.

The goal for the 1.0 release is to have a fully decentralised "internet
operating system" style platform, but right now we're working on creating a
basic, working proof of concept: version ``Zero``.


Get Started
-----------

You need to have Git 1.7.x, a recent Python 2.x and general dev tools (gcc,
make, etc.) installed.

.. syntax:: bash

  # clone the source repository.
  $ git clone http://github.com/tav/ampify.git

  # setup ampify related environment variables using
  # the ampenv.sh bash script. you might also want
  # to add the line to your ~/.profile
  # or ~/.bashrc files.
  $ source ampify/environ/ampenv.sh

  # use the new git update command which will now be
  # on your $PATH to keep the repository updated from
  # now on — it also inits and updates git submodules.
  $ cd ampify
  $ git update

  # configure your build and verify you have the
  # necessary dependencies.
  $ cd src
  $ ./configure

  # build various aspects of the ampify platform and
  # verify everything works by running the tests.
  $ make test
