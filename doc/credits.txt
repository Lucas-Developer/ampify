* `Sofia Bustamante <http://sofiabustamante.com>`_, ``olasofia``

  * Provided a lot of invaluable help/guidance at various stages.

  * Helped identify specific elements of the Confluence model and isolate the
    notion of "perspectives" from process work.

* `Charles Goodier <http://doid.com>`_, ``mediovia``

  * Pointed out that Ampify would be super useful in certain business contexts.

* `Felix Geisend√∂rfer <http://debuggable.com>`_, ``felixge``
