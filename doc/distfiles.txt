Distfiles
=========

Ampify makes use of a number of different open source libraries and platforms.
Unfortunately, given the use of bleeding edge versions, it's not reasonable to
expect users to have the required versions already installed on their systems.

To resolve this issue, an ``amp build`` mechanism is provided to download and
compile the various dependencies on demand. This document describes the manner
in which the various package distfiles (source tarballs) are generated.

The packages will generally be stripped of things like documentation and
examples in order to minimise the bandwidth requirement. And in some cases, the
packaged distfiles will have various patches to support functionality that we
desire.

**bsdiff**

  The distfile is generated from the ``bsdiff 4.3`` version and has the
  ``bspatch.c`` file patched with the following line:

  .. syntax:: c

    #include <sys/types.h>

  The ``Makefile`` is also patched to skip the installation -- including that of
  the man pages which have been removed.

**bzip2**

  The distfile is generated from the ``bzip2 1.0.5`` version and has the
  ``Makefile`` patched to:

  * Make symlinks appropriately.
  * Use the ``1.0.5`` version number instead of ``1.0.4``.
  * Generate a shared ``.dylib`` file on OS X.

**readline**

  The distfile is generated from the ``readline 6.1`` version and everything
  except for the ``Makefile.in`` files are removed from the following
  directories::

    doc/
    examples/

  The ``Makefile.in`` files are patched to do nothing on ``make install``.

**openssl**

  The distfile is generated from the ``openssl 0.9.8o`` version and is patched
  to support various TLS extensions:

  * `False Start <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bmoeller-tls-falsestart>`_

  * `Snap Start <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-agl-tls-snapstart>`_

  * `Next Protocol Negotiation
    <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-agl-tls-nextprotoneg>`_

**zlib**

  The distfile is generated from the ``zlib 1.2.5`` version and is stripped of
  the following directories::

    contrib/
    doc/
    examples/
    old/
