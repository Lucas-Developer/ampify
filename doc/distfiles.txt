Distfiles
=========

Ampify makes use of a number of different open source libraries and platforms.
Unfortunately, given the use of bleeding edge versions, it's not reasonable to
expect users to have the required versions already installed on their systems.

To resolve this issue, an ``redpill build`` mechanism is provided to download
and compile the various dependencies on demand. This document describes the
manner in which the various package distfiles (source tarballs) are generated.

The packages will generally be stripped of things like documentation and
examples in order to minimise the bandwidth requirement. And in some cases, the
packaged distfiles will have various patches to support functionality that we
desire.

**bsdiff**

  The distfile is generated from the ``bsdiff 4.3`` version and has the
  ``bspatch.c`` file patched with the following line:

  .. syntax:: c

    #include <sys/types.h>

  The ``Makefile`` is also patched to skip the installation -- including that of
  the man pages which have been removed.

**bzip2**

  The distfile is generated from the ``bzip2 1.0.5`` version and has the
  ``Makefile`` patched to:

  * Make symlinks appropriately.
  * Use the ``1.0.5`` version number instead of ``1.0.4``.
  * Generate a shared ``.dylib`` file on OS X.

**cacerts**

  The distfile consists of the ``ca.cert`` file which is generated from
  `Mozilla's Root Certificates file
  <https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt?raw=1>`_
  using Adam Langley's `extract-nss-root-certs utility
  <https://github.com/agl/extract-nss-root-certs>`_.

**go**

  The distfile is generated from the `Go repository on Google Code
  <http://code.google.com/p/go/source/checkout>`_ which is checked out with the
  command:

  .. syntax:: bash

    $ hg clone https://code.google.com/p/go/

  The following files and directories are then stripped::

    .hg/
    .hgignore
    .hgtags
    doc
    test

  The ``src/cmd/dist/build.c`` file is then patched to comment out the line::

    // xremove(bpathf(&b, "%s/VERSION.cache", goroot));

  And, finally, the output of ``dist version`` is saved to a ``VERSION.cache``
  file in the root directory before the distfile is tarballed.

**ucd**

  The distfile is generated from the public `Unicode Character Database files
  <http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/>`_.
