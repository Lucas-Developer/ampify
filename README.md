This is the repo for the Ampify Platform which aims to make micro-data powered  
application development and decentralised collaboration super easy. For  
comparison, perhaps imagine a bastardised mix between Unix, IRC, App Engine,  
[Xanadu] and Wikis.

The goal for the 1.0 release is to have a fully decentralised "internet  
operating system" style platform, but right now we're working on creating a  
working proof of concept: version `Zero`. For more info, please see the `doc`  
directory or visit:

* online docs: [http://ampify.it]
* mailing list: [http://groups.google.com/group/ampify]
* irc channel: [irc://irc.freenode.net/esp]

Note: this is very much a work in progress and not much works yet — faster  
development is dependent on your involvement =)

Enjoy, tav <<tav@espians.com>>
