This is the repo for Ampify — an open and decentralised application platform.  
For comparison, perhaps imagine a bastardised mix between Unix, Facebook, IRC,  
App Engine, [Xanadu] and Wikis.

The goal for the 1.0 release is to have a fully decentralised "internet  
operating system" style platform, but right now we're working on creating a  
working proof of concept: version `Zero`.

**Getting Started**

    $ source environ/ampenv.sh
    $ git update
    $ ./configure
    $ make

**Contribute**

development is dependent on your involvement =)
